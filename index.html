			<h2>The First Day</h2>
			<p>
				You wake up in the middle of a dark forest.
				There's nothing around but electronic trash.
				The sky above is grey, the trees made of plastic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Around you there is not much to eat or drink, no one to talk to.
				However, you note the eletronic nature of your surounding,
				everything looks like it was made for consumers.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are only a few things in your inventory:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 plastic-wrapped sandwiches</li>
				<li>4 bottles full of water</li> 
				<li>3 pills of a cure-all medication</li>
				<li>A crumpled letter from an anonymous sender</li>
				<li>Your trusty digital advisor Joplin&#8482;</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Nice to Meet</h2>
			<p>
				You open the letter and start reading:
			</p>
			<p>
				Dear Reader, I have been forsaken here at my electronic fortress
				for what feels like ages. This once marvelous place is now in
				ruins.  It used to be filled with wonder and excitment,
				everywhere you went in this forest, my creation, you could hear
				the children laugh, the people marvel, you could smell the
				fresh smell of recently unwrapped plastic.
				Now this is only a faded memory, this forest of ingenuity;
				And there's nothing for me, this old fool whose letter you're
				holding, to take pride in now.
				I have accepted my fate; but I've not accepted the forest's!
				I beg you, dear reader, find me in this forest. I've left a few
				clues for you to follow. Find me and help me restore the glory
				of my electronic creation here!
				Farewell, dear friend.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon closing the letter, you hear a quick blip sound, and the
				letter starts to burn. As the letter turns to ashes in your hand,
				you notice that out of the ashes comes out a little cog-shaped key.
				And on it there's a binary number.
			</p>
      <pre id="key">
         ___
        /   \
        +   +=======+==+=+
        \___/       |  | |
      </pre>
		</div>

		<!-- Chapter 3 -->
		<div id="chapter3" class="chapter">
			<h2>A Dear Friend</h2>
			<p>
				Now you realize that all of this is a little too complicated
				for your simple, organic mind. So you turn to a dear friend,
				your trusty digital advisor Joplin&#8482;.
			</p>
			<p>
				A form opens up, and you need to log in:
			</p>
      <label>Username:</label>
      <input type="text" id="username-input" autocomplete="off">
      <button id="username-login">Login</button>

		<pre id="joplin-welcome">
